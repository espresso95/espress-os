//! # EspressOS Kernel
//! 
//! A minimal operating system kernel written in Rust for the x86_64 architecture.
//! This module provides VGA text mode output functionality for displaying text
//! to the screen in a no_std environment.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - VGA text mode output with 16 colors
//! - Thread-safe text writer using spin locks
//! - Print macros for easy text output
//! - Automatic line wrapping and scrolling
